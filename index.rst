The Minecraft Overviewer
========================

Introduction
============
The Minecraft Overviewer is a command-line tool for rendering high-resolution
maps of Minecraft worlds. It generates a set of static html and image files and
uses the Google Maps API to display a nice interactive map.

The Overviewer has been in active development for over a year and has many
features, including day and night lighting, cave rendering, mineral overlays,
and many plugins for even more features! It is written mostly in Python with
critical sections in C as an extension module.

For a simple example of what your renders will look like, head over to `The
"Exmaple" Map <http://overviewer.org/example/>`_. For more user-contributed
examples, see `The Example Wiki Page <https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/wiki/Map-examples>`_.
